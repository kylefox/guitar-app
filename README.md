This is an experiment in _**âœ¨ Vibe Codingâ„¢ âœ¨**_ with Claude Code.

Aside from this initial prompt, nothing in this codebase was written by a human:

> I want to build a simple app for tracking my guitar collection. I want to keep track of each guitar I own or have owned (model, serial number, date purchased, price, photos, etc) as well as a history of service (string changes, repairs, etc). I want the app to work in a web browser on desktop/mobile, and ideally be installable as a progressive web app (PWA) so it feels like a native app.
